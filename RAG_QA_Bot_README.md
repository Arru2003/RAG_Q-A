# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for QA Bot

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question-Answering (QA) bot. The bot combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers for business use cases.

## Features

- **Retrieval Augmentation:** Leverages a vector database (Pinecone DB) to fetch relevant documents based on the input query.
- **Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT API for generating coherent and context-specific responses.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines the strengths of retrieval and generation for enhanced performance.
- **Business-Focused QA:** Optimized for answering business-related queries with high precision.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `conda`)
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI API
  - Pinecone DB

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RAG_QA_Bot.git
   cd RAG_QA_Bot
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   PINECONE_API_KEY=<your_pinecone_api_key>
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=<your_pinecone_environment>
   PINECONE_INDEX=<your_pinecone_index>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

   - Prepare a dataset of documents (e.g., FAQs, manuals, articles) relevant to your business.
   - Convert documents into vector embeddings using a pre-trained model (e.g., Sentence Transformers).
   - Index the embeddings into Pinecone DB.

2. **Run the QA Bot:**

   - Start the application:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - Enter your query, and the bot will return a response generated by the RAG model.

## Key Components

- **Pinecone DB:**

  - Stores and retrieves document embeddings efficiently.
  - Ensures low-latency query response times.

- **OpenAI GPT API:**

  - Generates natural language responses based on the retrieved documents.
  - Provides high-quality language understanding and generation.

- **Integration Workflow:**

  1. Query is vectorized using an embedding model.
  2. Vector is used to search the Pinecone index for relevant documents.
  3. Retrieved documents are provided as context to the GPT model.
  4. GPT generates the final answer.

## Example Query

Input:

```
"What are the business hours of our customer support team?"
```

Output:

```
"Our customer support team is available Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 6 PM."
```
